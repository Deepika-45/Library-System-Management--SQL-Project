# Library Management System using SQL Project --P2

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `library_db`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/najirh/Library-System-Management---P2/blob/main/library_erd.png)

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;

CREATE TABLE branches (
    branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(255),
    branch_location VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(255),
    emp_position VARCHAR(255),
    emp_salary FLOAT,
    branch_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branches(branch_id)
);

CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_name VARCHAR(255),
    membership_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_title VARCHAR(255),
    book_author VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(255),
    available_copies INT
);

CREATE TABLE issued_status (
    issue_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    issue_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id)
);

CREATE TABLE return_status (
    return_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    issue_id INT,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (issue_id) REFERENCES issued_status(issue_id)
);
```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS104' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS104';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE membership_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.emp_id,
    e1.emp_name,
    e1.position,
    e1.salary,
    b.*,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN 
branch as b
ON e1.branch_id = b.branch_id    
JOIN
employees as e2
ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expensive_books AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```

### Advanced SQL Operations

Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.


Task 14: Update Book Status on Return
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "available" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).



Task 15: Branch Performance Report
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.


Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 6 months.



Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.


Task 18: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" in the books table. Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.    


Task 19: Stored Procedure
Objective: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
    Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book based on its issuance or return. Specifically:
    If a book is issued, the status should change to 'no'.
    If a book is returned, the status should change to 'yes'.

Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS)
Objective: Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.

Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 30 days. The table should include:
    The number of overdue books.
    The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50.
    The number of books issued by each member.
    The resulting table should show:
    Member ID
    Number of overdue books
    Total fines
